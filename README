Nutshell is a simple, modular shell. It allows for the loading of
multiple command sets through modules called "nuts". I required
a shell that allowed me to switch the commands available but still
provide the basic shell structure so nutshell was born. The shell
is scriptable int that it can load scripts and run them with the
current command set.

To compile the shell, just run 'make'.

To compile the 'core' nut, just change directory to modules/core
and run 'make'. Remember to copy the 'core.nut' file to the root
directory.

At the moment, nutshell looks in its current directory and loads
all files ending with the '.nut' extension.

The shell also looks for a file called .nutrc in the current 
directory and loads it at startup. Useful for adding initializers.
